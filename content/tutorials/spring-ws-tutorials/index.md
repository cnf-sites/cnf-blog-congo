## What is Spring WS?

Spring Web Services (Spring-WS) is a product of the Spring community focused on creating document-driven [Web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service).

It facilitates contract-first [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) service development, allowing for a number of ways to manipulate [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) payloads.

Spring-WS is developed and maintained by [Pivotal Software](https://pivotal.io/).
