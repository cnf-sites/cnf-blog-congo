Following tutorials will help you understand [JMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service) in record time.

The best part?

They all come with **detailed explanations**, source code, and accompanying test cases.

Let's get this show on the road.

## What is JMS?

The [Java Message Service (JMS) API](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnceh.html) is a Java Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) API for sending messages between two or more clients.

It is a Java API that allows applications to create, send, receive, and read messages. The JMS API enables communication that is loosely coupled, asynchronous and reliable.
