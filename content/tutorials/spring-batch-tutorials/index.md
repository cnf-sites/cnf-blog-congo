## What is Spring Batch?

[Spring Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Batch) is an open source framework for batch processing. It provides **reusable functions** that you can use to **process large volumes of records**.

Spring Batch works by first reading items from a specified source. Then in a next step, the items are processed. And finally, the processed items are written to a specified destination.

Spring Batch is a [Spring main project](https://spring.io/projects).

It is developed and maintained by [Pivotal Software](https://pivotal.io/).
