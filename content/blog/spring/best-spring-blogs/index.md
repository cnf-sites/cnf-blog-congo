Looking for a list of the best blogs on [Spring](https://spring.io/)?

Then look no further.

As today I'm sharing my favorite resources for learning about the Spring framework.

So without further ado, let's get started…

## 1. [The Spring Blog](https://spring.io/blog)

This one might be an obvious pick as the Spring Team maintains a Spring blog.

It contains the newest releases of the different Spring frameworks. You'll also find several tutorials and detailed how-to guides. As well as announcements and the latest news and events around the Spring community.
