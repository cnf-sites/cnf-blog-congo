Hi there!

I'm William, a software engineer with a passion for teaching and building stuff on the web.

I enjoy tinkering around with code (especially using the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/)) and sometimes I blog about it.

Currently, I am very interested in software architecture, application integration, and security.

Besides my family and friends here are some other things I love:

* Science and technology in general
* Stand-up comedy, especially observational comedy: [Bill Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks), [Russell Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Peters)
* LEGO Space from the '80-'90s: [Futuron](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catType=S&catString=34.303), [Space Police I](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catType=S&catString=34.308)

Enjoy reading!
